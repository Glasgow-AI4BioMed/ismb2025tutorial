Firstly, if you are running the code on a machine you control, then you are able to use sensitive data (e.g. patient medical records) which typically can't be transmitted outside an organisation. It also gives you fine-grained control over the LLM and can enable some adjustments to the LLM. However, it potentially requires a large GPU (or GPUs) and the best performing models are not publicly available.\n",

LLMs are largely composed of a huge number of matrix multiplications, and the count of values across all their internal matrices gives the parameter count. The largest best performing models are measured in the hundreds of billions - which requires multiple of the most expensive GPUs to run. Smaller models in the 1B to 70B range can be run on more reasonable GPUs (with a few tricks).\n",
